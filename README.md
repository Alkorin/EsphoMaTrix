# EsphoMaTrix
A simple DIY status display with an 8x32 RGB LED panel implemented with esphome.io

# Introdution

There are some status displays out there, the commercial one from lamtric and some DIY alternatives. 

- [LaMetric](https://lametric.com/en-US/) commercial ~ 199â‚¬
- [Awtrix](https://awtrixdocs.blueforcer.de/#/)
- [PixelIt](https://docs.bastelbunker.de/pixelit/)
-
The DIY solutions have their pros and cons, i am still using an awtrix. But the cons are so big (after my opinion) that i started an esphome.io variant with an optimized homeassistant integration.

# State

It is not as mature as awtrix and pixelt it but i does what i need.
